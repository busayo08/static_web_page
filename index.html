    <blockquote>Dufuna-Fem NYSC & Graduates Code Camp, an initiative of AHK Nigeria, is a Software Engineering training program targeted towards female NYSC corps members and graduates which will run in Lagos and Ibadan concurrently. This program will help increase the number of female software engineers in the tech industry by providing them with the skills needed for a great software engineering career. The code camp is a self-study program with mentors assigned to scholars to check in on their progress. The program will also consist of a bi-weekly physical meetup in the two locations where scholars will be able to physically interact with their mentors and one another.</blockquote>
